            <p> I study in Chatsworth International School. In that school, I am in Secondary School. However, Year 7 means Grade 6 in Singapore, so in reality I might not be in Secondary, but in this school I am a secondary student.</p>
            <p> About my school: https://www.chatsworth.com.sg</p>
             <p> I have somewhat average scores in school, nothing too bad really. </p>
             <p> In my class, I could possibly the most knowledgeable when it comes to Politics, History and Geography </p>
             <p> I am horrible at Maths and Science. </p>
             <p> SCHOOL STUFF THAT JUST HAPPENED! </p>
             <p> In elementary school (Year 6), everytime someone has a birthday we would have at least 1-2 cakes made to celebrate their birthday. </p>
             <p> My elementary class nearly had a fight with the other class. </p>
             <p> In terms of sports (Year 6), we had a huge conflict between Year 5, who were caught cheating, mentioning slurs, and many more. Year 5 eventually grouped up and teachers started lecturing them. </p>
             <p> After COVID-19 appeared, the amount of people playing soccer dropped down by 90%</p>
             <p> Tag was a very popular game in school, but with the COVID-19 restrictions implemented to schools, people started bypassing the rules by playing shadow tag. This was eventually banned after. </p>
             <p> Somebody proposed an option to give bats for everyone to defend themselves if bad things happened. They nearly approved the idea.</p>
             <p> The house captains (its like class president, and a house is like a group, similar to the houses in Harry Potter) election were based on popularity (people would vote the most known people) and not their skill (my friend, who had experience in becoming a leader and is a big brother to 2 people lost the election to somebody who is horrible at leading people, but is so popular because of his sporty nature) </p>
             <p> I was originally called the class nerd at school and was told to be as annoying as the most annoying person in school. But after 2 weeks I was one of the most likeable people in school.</p>
             <p> CCA's: Swimming, Basketball, Tennis, Badminton, Mindfulness, (thats all i know for now) </p>
             <p> (More to be added here so be prepared for nerdy stuff in the future that I'll share here) </p>
             <p> My school looks like this: </p>
